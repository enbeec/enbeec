I made it right after my React/Django bootcamp and it's been sitting there collecting dust since.

Now that `react-dnd` is no longer an active library I'm thinking about what to do with that space. 
If you love the goofy little drag board, let me know! 
I'm torn on whether to fix it up or move on to something else.
Either way it will be a fun, slightly over-complicated front-end project when I have time for that.

## 🚧 *Coming Soon* 🚧 New and improved blog!

I'm working on a new blog *(with initial content harvested from one of the abandoned blogs I've kept over the years).*

I'm planning on doing something very simple and maintainable long term that I will actually use 😅.
