## 💜 Code Projects 🌌

- [BastilleBSD](https://bastillebsd.org/) template to null mount my homedir in a jail --> [[here]](https://github.com/enbeec/bastille-templates)
  - I have a few other templates on a home server I may publish if I can work out a few bugs *(or publish to get the bugs worked out?)*
  - Until something like [`runj`](https://github.com/samuelkarp/runj) is ready for use by someone with limited free time like me, Bastille is the closest I can get to the config-as-code ease of Docker

- My Bootcamp Capstone Project **RGBlent**
  - Silly little color app that lets you blend two colors together and share the results
  - Creatively stores colors collaboratively in the database
  - Highlights:
    - see the DX features in [the server](https://github.com/enbeec/rgblent-server)
      - `init_database.sh` helped me move very quickly while developing
      - the color formatting code for the database fixtures also made things quick and felt good to share
    - I got dragged away from the client by my job search which is [apparent from the TODO list in the README](https://github.com/enbeec/rgblent-client) **but**
      - the structure of the code is very readable, IMO
      - it was a valiant noob-y attempt at CSS-in-JS before I settled on Tailwind
