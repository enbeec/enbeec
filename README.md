## 💜 OS Tomfoolery 🌌

- [BastilleBSD](https://bastillebsd.org/) template to null mount my homedir in a jail --> [[here]](https://github.com/enbeec/bastille-templates)
  - I have a few other templates on a home server I may publish if I can work out a few bugs *(or publish to get the bugs worked out?)*
  - Until something like [`runj`](https://github.com/samuelkarp/runj) is ready for use by someone with limited free time like me, Bastille is the closest I can get to the config-as-code ease of Docker
