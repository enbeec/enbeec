# 💛 Val Currie 💫

## ❤️ [Check out my website!](https://about.valcurrie.com) 💥

I made it right after my React/Django bootcamp and it's been sitting there collecting dust since.

Now that `react-dnd` is no longer an active library I'm thinking about what to do with that space. 
If you love the goofy little drag board, let me know! 
I'm torn on whether to fix it up or move on to something else.
Either way it will be a fun, slightly over-complicated front-end project when I have time for that.

## 🚧 *Coming Soon* 🚧 New and improved blog!

I'm working on a new blog *(with initial content harvested from one of the abandoned blogs I've kept over the years).*

I'm planning on doing something [like this](https://github.com/enbeec/walt) long term that I will actually use 😅.

## 💙 Art Projects 🌊

[Lissajous Harmonics (Teensy OLED)](https://github.com/enbeec/lissajous-demo)

## 💜 OS Tomfoolery 🌌

- [BastilleBSD](https://bastillebsd.org/) template to null mount my homedir in a jail --> [[here]](https://github.com/enbeec/bastille-templates)
  - I have a few other templates on a home server I may publish if I can work out a few bugs *(or publish to get the bugs worked out?)*
  - Until something like [`runj`](https://github.com/samuelkarp/runj) is ready for use by someone with limited free time like me, Bastille is the closest I can get to the config-as-code ease of Docker
